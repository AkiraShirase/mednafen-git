***Major issues***

Battle Arena Toshinden and Zero Divide runs too fast(related to CPU or GPU emulation speed?).

Tiny Toon Adventures - Plucky's Big Adventure is failing and BREAK'ing for some reason during startup, probably because the emulated CPU
is running too fast.

Tetris with Cardcaptor Sakura - Locks up at the room-lighting warning screen.

Ballblazer Champions - Locks up during startup; probably a CPU timing issue.

Tomb Raider(PAL) - (reported, not personally investigated yet) "was fighting Tomb Raider PAL this night, when you get out of pool in Lara's home the game bugs out: issues GetlocP, waits for it to complete and expects seek to be NOT complete (i.e. older location)"

Monkey Hero - Locks up during/after title screen.

Freestyle Motocross: McGrath vs. Pastrana - Random fairly long(but finite) freezes during gameplay.  Possibly CPU instruction-timing
related.  Possibly CDC-timing related(emulating the currently-missing delay between command/args received and command executed might fix it).

Tales of Destiny (Japanese version 1.0) - Reported to have random freezes after battles(not confirmed yet).  US version is reported
to not suffer from this problem.

FIFA - Road to Worldcup 98 (USA) - Locks up after legal screen is displayed at startup; probably CPU instruction timing-related(decreasing
the IPC fixes this problem).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Medium issues***

Championship Motocross 2001 - Invisible driver.  GHOSTRIDER~  The palette data in RAM is apparently being selectively zero'd out between
the DMA from CDC and the DMA to GPU for some reason.  Timing issue related maybe?  (Probably CPU instruction timing issue)

Incredible Crisis - Garbled in-game dialogue text boxes.  Probably CPU instruction timing-related(decreasing the IPC fixes this problem).

Nicktoons Racing - Fubared sound effects.  Probably CPU instruction timing-related(decreasing the IPC fixes this problem).

Wing Commander III - Music during flight sounds screwed up, with missing notes and notes cut off too early.  Maybe it's supposed to be
like that; need to test it on a PS1 to find out.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Lesser issues***

Resident Evil 2 - Lockup on second disc in a certain place; probably related to seek timing(might be fixed now?).

Shadow Master might have broken startup images.

Crusaders of Might and Magic - The CD-XA buffering increase for ToD II is apparently exacerbating the early voice cutoff problem in this game.

Crash Team Racing - Noticed a game lockup once in the arcade mode stage select screen, having trouble reproducing it.

WipeOut 3 - Music stops playing after a long while(maybe it's supposed to do that?).

Nightmare Creatures - BIOS reverb sound excessively contaminates beginning of game; emulating CD "Reset" command timing more
accurately might fix it.

Eldergate - Screen garbage after "world creation", disappears if town is entered; might be caused by CD reading or
seeking being too fast?  Or possibly a CPU instruction timing issue...hmm.

Castrol Honda Superbike Racing - Graphical glitches on menus.

Vigilante 8 - Has weird red and green(and a few blue) garbage pixels in patches sometimes during gameplay; "garbage" pixel placement
is somewhat sparse, so it might not even be noticeable if it were to occur on a PS1 with composite or S-video output, due to limited
chroma bandwidth.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ensure(long-term, IE a note to the FUTURE) that input device state is latched in independent variables at the start of the
input device's handling of a state read command, so that when games are reading device state across an MDFNI_Emulate() boundary, the
data won't change in the middle, which could hypothetically cause problems in some rare circumstances(and make entering 
button combos in games more finicky).

Investigate CD-XA FIR filter on a PS1, for 4-bit and 8-bit modes, and both playback rates.  Might be difficult without a modchip,
though...

Respect device(GPU, SPU, etc.) DMA mode/memory access mode bits(more for homebrew's sake than commercial games'). 

Test if Dual Analog vibration compatibility mode can be restored with DualShock after using DualShock extended features if the "Analog"
mode button on the gamepad is pressed after the extended features are used.

Test time delta between GPU LL DMA end and GPU non-busy status for various primitive types in sequence on a PS1.

Test IRQ and COP0 latencies; PSX IRQ controller latency, software IRQ bit latency, latency of both relevant COP0 IRQ enable bits.

Test IRQ with LWC2.

Test IRQ with COP0 instructions(interrupted execution or not?).

Determine maximum quad height and width.  See if drawing is an all-or-nothing thing, or if one triangle of the pair will still be drawn
if it's not too large.

Test 0x0 and 1x1 polygon throughput for all triangle and quad drawing commands.

Fix line drawing algorithm to match test results on the real thing.


Test time between voice on and envelope reset; test time between voice on and first ADPCM block memory fetch.

The SPU in the PS1 might sometimes drop voice on events when playing an ADPCM block that loops to itself(and was also the first and only
ADPCM block, at least in the test program I noticed the issue in); investigate further.



Make sure debugger COPn disassembly is correct(no typos or whatnot).
